# Lifeway Challenge

This is my first project using Nextjs, and my first with any testing library.

I had a bit of a learning curve to getting a MVP, but I really enjoyed the process, and also enjoy Nextjs.


## Development
I went through a few iterations of the initial SWAPI call, but ultimately landed on one function, with a few try/catch statements to get the data, and make the next API calls to get the starship, film, and species info.


## Add next?
If I would have had more time, I would have spent time doing some more styling outside of just Bootstrap, and also dove more into Jest. I currently have a test that is just checking if the page loads. Simulating an API call is not as easy as it sounds, but I found some documentation on similating the call with hard-coding a dummy response, which sounds promising.


## Run this project

To run the project, clone this repo and run 'npm install'. You should be able to 'npm run dev' which will launch the dev version. To run the Jest testing, run 'npm run test'.
